        "prompt": "How do I make Chicha Peruana?",
        "completion": "Step 1: Procedure: mash for 90 minutes at 160\u00b0f. Step 2: We did two 1.5 gallon batches, each spiced differently (one with curacao/coriander, the other with allspice/cinammon). we would rather have used a higher proportion of jora, but on brewday we discovered that our ability to determine the weight of things is seriously imparied. Step 3: Instead of the 4.5lbs we thought we had, we found we had only 3lbs of jora. Step 4: Rather than readjust (the og would have been more appropriate at ~1.045 in any case), we added more sugar, a course of action that was inspired by homebrewed weizen as much as anything else. the result is a very tasty beverage, pretty big all the way around on corn, and yet the flavor is quite subtle. be warned that chicha is at its peak 2 to 4 days after pitching while it still retains some sweetness and body.\", \r\n\"once the chicha ferments out, you are left with a fairly bland beverage that reminds me of iced tea more than anything else. if i'd been thinking (chicha lends itself to gulping), i would have kegged the stuff on the third day after pitching and stuck it in the fridge. while we took the trouble to grow our own (blue) corn, i see no reason why one could not start with good ol' yellow corn from the grocery store (domestic 20-row?) in fact, i plan on doing this if only to see what kind of chicha it makes.\", \r\n\"specifics:  og: 1.055  fg: 1.012 types of chicha so far, there appear to me to be several main ways in which chicha de jora is made. these range in difficulty from trivial to a process almost indentical to what barley-beer homebrewers are familiar with. Step 5: Facil (easy) - corn is mixed with water and sugar and allowed to sit for several days until the corn begins to germinate. the sugar ferments and the corn, lending nothing fermentable, adds flavor. Step 6: Abbreviated - the jora is mashed but the mash is ultimately brought to a boil, allowed to settle, and the clear liquid, or upi, now finished chicha, is drawn off.\", \r\n\"traditional - similiar to the abbreviated method, but the jora is mashed and the mash is allowed to settle. the upi is drawn off the mash into a separate vessel for boiling. Step 7: Modern - the ground jora is mashed and lautered through some sort of filtering device such as a manifold or false bottom. Step 8: This process is helped by the inclusion of some crushed malted barley (barley assisted). the first is apparently how much chicha is made in people's kitchens. Step 9: Bill ridgely describes most of the others in his articles.\", \r\n\"also note that the methods that include mashing use a batch sparge. that is, the sweet liquor (upi) is merely drained from the mash and there are no continuous additions of sparge water to the surface of the mash. Step 10: Certainly sparging can be performed if desired, but it is neither traditional nor necessary (corn kernels have no husk and therefore do not form a filterbed). chicha is traditionally allowed to spontaneously ferment. for the last type (modern), george duarte suggests that ground, unmalted corn could be mixed with a small amount of crushed 2-row malted barley and boiled for 20 minutes or so to gelatinize the starch in the corn.\", \r\n\"this gooey mass would then be added to more water and barley malt and mashed as per 'normal' homebrew procedures. Step 11: This could probably be sparged as usual."

Step 2: Here is the way our family does it. there are other  methods of seasoning and roasting but we are always satisfied with the results  this way. Step 3: Try to buy a whole fillet that is already \\\"peeled \\\" ( trimmed of  silverskin, fat etc. ) or if you prefer you can buy untrimmed and do it  yourself. Step 4: The whole filet has a taped part ( called the tail ) and when you  roast, tuck this part under so you can have a more even  piece of meat for  roasting.\", \r\n\"if the whole filet is too large to fit your roasting pan you may cut  the filet in half and roast the two parts in the pan together. Step 5: Make sure the  meat comes to room temperature prior to roasting for even roasting which also  helps with tenderness. Step 6: Rub oil ( we prefer olive ) over the filet and then rub in seasonings such as salt , pepper, paprika, crushed garlic etc. the montreal  steak seasoning is a nice choice ( available in the seasoning or meat sections  of supermarkets ) . Step 7: Or other people prefer to coat the filet with dijon mustard  and then roll the filet in  finely crushed black or colored peppercorns prior to roasting.\", \r\n\"both ways are delicious.

Step 11: Place the prepared filet on the rack and  roast 20 minutes ( for a average 5 lb roast- ). then decrease the temperature to 350f and roast an additional 20 minutes. Step 12: Remove the filet from the oven and let  sit about 15 minutes before slicing. Step 13: This total time factor  should produce  medium rare.  a heavier roast will probably need more roasting time and a  smaller roast less time. the sitting times allows for best slicing and lets some of the juices settle etc.    if you prefer you can  check and rely on a meat  thermometer to test so you don't under or over roast the meat..\", \r\n\"insert  thermometer in the thickest part of the roast. generally 120 to 130 f is rare  and 130 to 140 f is medium rare. remember the meat will continue to cook with  \\\"standing time\\\" out of the oven.

Step 6: This is supposed to  happen, so don't worry about it, and don't try to scrape it up and  incorporate it into the dough, or you will have plaster chips in your  pastries.\", \r\n\"the dough should be soft, but when you pinch it between thumb  and forefinger it should not stick to your hand. Step 7: Dump the panade into a  bowl, and let it cool for at least 5 minutes. Step 8: Then add the eggs, one at a  time, beating well after each addition. Step 9: The mixture should be smooth and  creamy looking before you add the next egg. Step 10: After all 4 eggs have been  beaten in, the dough will be shiny and satiny yellow, thick and heavy. Step 11: Butter and flour a cookie sheet. fill a pastry bag with the dough.\", \r\n\"if you  don't have a pastry bag, you can use a tablespoon to drop dollops of  dough onto the cookie sheet for eclairs and/or cream puffs, but you  really must have a pastry bag in order to make a cream puff ring. Step 12: For cream puffs, squeeze out balls about the size of ping pong or golf  balls. Step 13: For eclairs, squeeze out oblongs at 3 to 4 inches long. Step 14: If you are using  the recipe given above, you should end up with 14 to 16 pastries. Step 15: Don't  succumb to the temptation to make fewer and larger ones, for they won't  cook properly if you do.\", \r\n\"brush the tops of the pastries with beaten egg,  using the bristles of the brush to gently push down and flatten out the  little curlicues left by the pastry bag as you lifted it off. Step 16: Finally,  drag the tines of a dinner fork down the length of each eclair. Step 17: The  resulting stripes will make for a more attractive and professional  looking product. for a cream puff ring, first mark a 10\\\" circle on the surface of the  buttered and floured cookie sheet. then, using a pastry gab, squeeze out  a 1\\\" wide \\\"halo\\\" of cream puff paste right on top of the circle you've  outlined.\", \r\n\"squeeze another 1\\\" wide ring of dough adjacent to - and  touching - the first. squeeze a third ring directly over the \\\"crack\\\"  between the other two. Step 18: Brush the whole thing with beaten egg, and  sprinkle a handful of thinly sliced almonds all over the top of the ring. Step 19: Let the cream puffs, eclairs, or cream puff ring sit and \\\"dry\\\" for no  less than 15 and no more than 25 minutes before baking. Step 20: The oven should  be preheated to 375f for cream puffs and/or eclairs, and to 400f for a  cream puff ring.\", \r\n\"bake the former at 375f for about 30 minutes, or until  they have puffed up nicely and turned golden brown. Step 21: Bake the latter at  400f for about 45 minutes, or until it is well puffed and golden brown. Step 22: Then, turn the oven off, open the door, and leave it halfway open for an  hour. Step 23: If it won't stay ajar by itself, prop it open by wedging something  in there. this is to allow steam to escape and to let the pastries cool  slowly and \\\"dry\\\" as they cool so that they won't collapse or become soft  and soggy.\", \r\n\"after an hour has passed, remove the pastries from the oven. Step 24: They are now ready to be filled. Step 25: To fill individual pastries: cut cream puffs and eclairs in half (from side to side, not from top to  bottom). fill with whatever filling you desire. replace lids. Step 26: Glaze with  icing or pour sauce on top. Step 27: Serve. it is wise not to fill pastries to far  in advance of the serving time. the closer the preparation time is to the  serving time, the smaller the likelihood that the pastries will begin to  soften or get soggy.\", \r\n\"to fill a cream ring:  use a slicing knife with a long serrated blade to cut the top off a cream  puff ring. Step 28: Fill the bottom with praline cream (or coffee cream, or  chocolate cream) filling. Step 29: Fill a pastry bag with sweetened whipped cream. Step 30: Use a nozzle with a zigzag edge (like pinking shears) to squeeze out a  layer of fancy puff-balls of whipped cream all over the layer of praline  cream filling. Step 31: Finally, replace the lid and dust the top with 10x  powdered confectioners' sugar. Step 32: Keep the cream puff ring in a cool dry  place until serving time.                  - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -                     *  exported from  mastercook  *                            praline filling recipe by     : homemade good news (vol 3 no 3) serving size  : 1    preparation time :0:00 categories    : pastries amount  measure       ingredient -- preparation method --------  ------------  --------------------------------  1      cup           10x powdered confectioners' sugar    1/2  cup           almonds make the vanilla custard cream.\", \r\n\"place the sugar and nuts in a heavy saucepan and place over medium heat.  stir constantly with a wooden spoon.
